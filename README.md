# SMOTS | Seam-sealing Machine Operator Training Simulator

![SMOTS](https://github.com/XROS-X-NIFT/SMOTS/assets/76243585/a0f3c8c8-13e4-4de2-9c35-0acd7c7a974c)

## About
This HoloLense2 application provides the user with an immersive experience of training on a Seam-Sealing machine. Using this he can learn to operate the machine in virtual simulation and when he will be using the actual machine he will be aware of its working.

Here users can get an experience of using the machine virtually anywhere any time. He requires to wear a Hololense headset and he can interact with the virtual objects in a real environment using just his hands and legs.

It was a 3-Month extended team project under the mentorship of excellent professors from **NIFT-Delhi**.

## Tech-Stacks

## Goals
- [x] The simulation is supposed to be as Immersive as possible.
- [x] The process steps should be beginner friendly and in-depth.
- [x] The virtual replica of the machine should be as detailed as possible.
- [x] Human interaction with virtual objects should be accurate and smooth.
- [x] Cloth physics should be accurate.
- [x] As much Interaction with the cloth as possible.
- [ ] Simulation with different fabrics with tape curved tape paths.
- [ ] Simulation should have voice instructions and multiple language support.
